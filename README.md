## Overview
Arduino is an open-source platform used for building electronics projects. This repository showcases different Arduino projects, ranging from simple blinking LEDs to more complex sensor integrations and automation systems.

Each project folder includes:
- **Source Code**: Arduino sketches (`.ino` files).
- **Circuit Diagrams**: Wiring diagrams for setting up the hardware.
- **Documentation**: A detailed explanation of the project, including its purpose, setup, and functionality.

## Projects
Some examples of the projects in this repository:
1. **Blinking LED**: The classic "Hello, World!" project for Arduino.
2. **Temperature Sensor**: Measure ambient temperature using a DHT11 or similar sensor and display it on an LCD.
3. **Obstacle Avoiding Robot**: A robot that uses ultrasonic sensors to detect and avoid obstacles.
4. **Light Following Robot**: A robot that follows a light source using LDR sensors.
5. **Smart Home System**: Basic automation using sensors (e.g., motion, light, and temperature).
6. **Weather Monitoring Station**: Collect temperature, humidity, and atmospheric pressure data.

> **Note**: Refer to individual project folders for detailed information.

## Getting Started
Follow these steps to set up and run the projects:

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/shrudh-i/arduino.git
cd arduino
```

### Hardware and Software Requirements

#### Hardware

- **Arduino Board**: Uno, Nano, Mega, or any compatible microcontroller.
- **Sensors and Modules**: Depending on the project (e.g., DHT11, ultrasonic sensors, LDRs).
- **Miscellaneous Components**: Resistors, LEDs, jumper wires, breadboards, etc.

#### Software

- **Arduino IDE**: Download and install from [Arduino's official website](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).
- **Libraries**: Some projects may require additional Arduino libraries. Install them via the Arduino Library Manager.

### How to Use

1. Connect your Arduino board to your computer via USB.
2. Open the Arduino IDE and load the `.ino` file for the project you want to run.
3. Ensure the correct board and port are selected in the IDE (`Tools > Board` and `Tools > Port`).
4. Compile and upload the code to your Arduino board.
5. Follow the circuit diagram in the project folder to set up the hardware.
6. Run the project and observe the results.
